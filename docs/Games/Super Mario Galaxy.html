                        <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> is a 3D-Platforming adventure game, and one of the highest rated video games of all time. It was the third 3D game in the 
                        <em>Super Mario</em> series, with a setting in space filled with galaxies and planets to explore.

                    <p>
                        This game is notable for its use of a full live orchestra for most of the game's music, which diverged from the more traditional jazzy music present in previous
                        <em>Super Mario</em> games. The soundtrack was mostly composed by a newer composer with the company, Mahito Yokota. However, to make sure that the music still captured
                        the essence of the series, veteran composer Koji Kondo was brought on to coach Yokota as development went on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the soundtrack was written, it was largely performed in a studio with an orchestra of about fifty musicians. The entire time, Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of 
                        the <em>Super Mario</em> series was closely watching, and ultimately very pleased with the choice of using an orchestra for the soundtrack.
