                    <p>
                        Grant Kirkhope was born July 10th, 1962 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He is probably best known for his musical contributions with game studio Rare, with some notable works being <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>,
                        and <em>Viva Pi&ntilde;ata</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before working on video game soundtracks, Kirkhope played in the rock bands "Little Angels" and "Tribe". He also received classical training while attending The Royal Northern College of Music. 
                        He was later employed by Rare in October 1995, marking his first job working on video game soundtracks. The first game he contributed music to after joining Rare was <em>Donkey Kong Land 2</em> for the Nintendo Gameboy. For this game, Kirkhope was 
                        tasked with arranging another composer, David Wise's songs from <em>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</em> to better fit the system's hardware. After working on this game, Kikhope was given the opportunity to work on many more well-known games, 
                        some in collaboration with other composers, and others by himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite enjoying many years working with Rare, Kirkhope would leave some time after the studio was purchased by Microsoft. This was largely due to the major changes Microsoft made to both the types of games Rare would produce, and to the general 
                        atmosphere of the studio. He has been working freelance since then, and has had the chance to work with smaller indepenent game studios and bigger studios alike. One of Kirkhope's most notable collaborations was with the game development company Nintendo 
                        for the game <em>Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em>.
                    </p>       
                    <p>
                        Kirkhope's musical style has varied a lot over the years. Some of his earlier works such as <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, <em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> showcase his
                        ability to write highly memorable and catchy tunes, with simpler instrumentations. His more recent works showcase his bigger and more grandeur orchestral style as seen in <em> Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em>, 
                        <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, and <em>Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</em>.
