                        Shiho Fujii is a Japanese composer who first joined Nintendo EAD in 2007. Her first official contribution to a video game's soundtrack
                        was <em>Wii Fit</em>, alongside Toru Minegishi and Manaka Takaoka. Since then, she has contributed to a few major Nintendo game franchises such as: <em>Super Mario</em>, 
                        <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Fujii grew up playing Nintendo games, starting with the the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game for the Super Famicom, or Super Nintendo Entertainment System. 
                        This early interest in Nintendo helped motivate Fujii to become a video game composer, as she went from trying to play various songs on the piano to wanting to write her own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of Shiho Fujii's compositions are fun and upbeat tracks, but she has also contributed bigger orchestral pieces such as those in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em>. 
                        When composing for a soundtrack, she priortizes matching the soundtrack to the atmosphere of the game. One of her main ambitions when composing is to try to create songs that will create fun memories
                        for players and stick with them long after hearing them in-game.
