                        Tee Lopes is a composer, arranger, and sound designer, well-known for working on the soundtrack of the 25th Anniversary celebration game for the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> series, 
                        <em>Sonic Mania</em>. Prior to this, Lopes had made fan arrangements of songs from games in the series, which eventually got the attention of the development company <em>Sega</em>.
                        Since then, he has also contributed to <em>Team Sonic Racing</em> and a series of animated shorts starring Sonic, <em>Sonic Mania Adventures</em>.

                        Tee Lopes is a self-taught musician, and formed his first band at the young age of nine. Some of his early works in music included working with local rappers and
                        creating his own remixes. In 2013, Lopes decided to focus on creating music primarily for video games. Before being recruited by Sega, Lopes had contributed music to several games for 
                        the indie game studio PagodaWest Games.
