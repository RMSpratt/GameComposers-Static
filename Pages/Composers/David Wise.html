                        David Wise is an English composer largely known for his works with publisher Rare, before going off to do freelance work. He was initially hired
                        by Tim and Chris Stamper, while working in a music shop. Wise first became interested in music by when his brother began taking piano lessons. 
                        Since he was too young to begin lessons himself at the time, so he began listening to and playing music by ear. Later, Wise would join a brass band 
                        and learn to play the drums.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> would be Wise's first contribution to a major Nintendo franchise, and was critically acclaimed for its soothing ambient tracks and
                      upbeat jungle beats. This was followed the next year by <em>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</em> which was even more diverse, and equally well-received.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since these works, David Wise has gone on to contribute to a number of well-known titles. A couple of his most recent saw him rejoin some former staff at Rare 
                        to provide music for Playtonic Games' <em> Yooka-Laylee</em> series.
