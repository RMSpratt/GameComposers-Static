                        Grant Kirkhope was born July 10th, 1962 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was originally employed by Rare in October 1995, 
                        making this his first job as a video game composer. Before this, he played for two bands. The first game he contributed music for was Killer Instinct 2. 
                        <br><br>
                        In his career, Grant Kirkhope has worked for quite a few well-known gaming companies including Rare, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Playtonic Games. He has also
                        done freelance work.

                    <p>
                        Kirkhope's musical style has varied a lot over the years. Some of his earlier works such as <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, <em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> showcase his
                        ability to write highly memorable and catchy tunes. His more recent works showcase his other bigger and more grandeur orchestral style as seen in <em> Mario & Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em>, 
                        <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, and <em>Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</em>.
