                        Grant Kirkhope was born July 10th, 1962 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His musical background before working on video games include playing in the rock bands "Little Angels" and "Tribe", as well as
                        receiving classical training while attending The Royal Northern College of Music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kirkhope was originally employed by Rare in October 1995, marking his first job as a video game composer. The first game he officially contributed music for was <em>Donkey Kong Land 2</em>, where he arranged 
                        David Wise's songs from <em>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</em> to fit the Gameboy. Since then, Grant Kirkhope has worked for numerous well-known gaming companies including Rare, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Playtonic Games.
                    </p>       
                    <p>
                        Kirkhope's musical style has varied a lot over the years. Some of his earlier works such as <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, <em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> showcase his
                        ability to write highly memorable and catchy tunes. His more recent works showcase his other bigger and more grandeur orchestral style as seen in <em> Mario & Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em>, 
                        <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, and <em>Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</em>.
