                        This small web project was designed to let me test my skills working with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, while learning more about some 
                        of my biggest inspirations in video game music. References are listed on each page where I cited articles or interviews about any of the 
                        composers or the games they worked on.

                        This version of the project is static, having no back-end connectivity or features. This was done so I could easily host it on Github Pages 
                        for testing across devices, and allow it to be viewed by anyone interested. A more in-depth version with more back-end functionality and database 
                        connectivity is being considered.
