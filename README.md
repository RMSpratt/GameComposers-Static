This is a small web-based project designed to let me practice my front-end development skills working with HTML, CSS, SASS, and some JavaScript. In-particular, I wanted to get familiar with creating responsive webpages for multiple devices, and learn some good code organization practices. This is a static web project, with no back-end connectivtiy or database access. A version of this project with those features is being considered.

As for the content of this project, this web app contains information about some video game composers and video game soundtracks that I take inspiration from in my own composing and arranging. I used this project to not only gain some coding experience, but to only learn about some of my musical heroes in more detail. 

I've tried to cite the websites and interviews I used when gathering information as best I could, and each individual webpage has specific sources listed at the bottom of it.
