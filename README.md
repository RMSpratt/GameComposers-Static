# Game Composers - Static Website
This is a small web-based project originally created to build my skills with HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript. 

## Description
This is a static web project, with no back-end connectivtiy or database access. This website suits a personal interest in video game music and composition with information about select musicians and video game sound tracks.

The cited sources are listed for each specific webpage, with information gained presumed to be up-to-date for the time of creation.

### Scaling
The website is designed to work well on multiple devices using responsive scaling.
